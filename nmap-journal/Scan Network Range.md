**Guide to options in this article**

| **Scanning Options** | **Description**  | 
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| `10.129.2.0/24` | Target network range. | 
| `-sn` | Disables port scanning. |
| `-oA tnet` | Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'. |
| `-iL hosts.lst`| Uses hosts.lst as input |
| `-PE` | Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target. | 
| `--reason` | Displays the reason for specific result. |
| `--packet-trace` | Shows all packets sent and received |


We can improve this script by providing an input list with an -iL option 
```shell-session
badgersec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not. 

In this example, we see that only 3 of 7 hosts are active. Remember, this may mean that the other hosts ignore the default **ICMP echo requests** because of their firewall configurations. Since `Nmap` does not receive a response, it marks those hosts as inactive.

```shell-session
badgersec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

If we disable port scan (`-sn`), Nmap automatically ping scan with `ICMP Echo Requests` (`-PE`). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an `ICMP reply` if the pinging host is alive. The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an `ARP ping` resulting in an `ARP reply`. We can confirm this with the "`--packet-trace`" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (`-PE`) for this.

```shell-session
badgersec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason
