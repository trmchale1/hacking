# Service Enumeration

It is recommended to perform a quick port scan first, which gives us a small overview of the available ports. This causes significantly less traffic, which is advantageous for us because otherwise we can be discovered and blocked by the security mechanisms. We can deal with these first and run a port scan in the background, which shows all open ports (`-p-`). We can use the version scan to scan the specific ports for services and their versions (`-sV`).

A full port scan takes quite a long time. To view the scan status, we can press the `[Space Bar]` during the scan, which will cause `Nmap` to show us the scan status.

```shell-session
badgersec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 19:44 CEST
[Space Bar]
Stats: 0:00:03 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (1 up), 1 undergoing SYN Stealth Scan
SYN Stealth Scan Timing: About 3.64% done; ETC: 19:45 (0:00:53 remaining)
```

Primarily, `Nmap` looks at the banners of the scanned ports and prints them out. If it cannot identify versions through the banners, `Nmap` attempts to identify them through a signature-based matching system, but this significantly increases the scan's duration. One disadvantage to `Nmap`'s presented results is that the automatic scan can miss some information because sometimes `Nmap` does not know how to handle it. Let us look at an example of this.

```shell-session
badgersec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-16 20:10 CEST

```

If we look at the results from `Nmap`, we can see the port's status, service name, and hostname. Nevertheless, let us look at this line here:

-   `NSOCK INFO [0.4200s] nsock_trace_handler_callback(): Callback: READ SUCCESS for EID 18 [10.129.2.28:25] (35 bytes): 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)..`

Then we see that the SMTP server on our target gave us more information than `Nmap` showed us. Because here, we see that it is the Linux distribution `Ubuntu`. It happens because, after a successful three-way handshake, the server often sends a banner for identification. This serves to let the client know which service it is working with. At the network level, this happens with a `PSH` flag in the TCP header. However, it can happen that some services do not immediately provide such information. It is also possible to remove or manipulate the banners from the respective services. If we `manually` connect to the SMTP server using `nc`, grab the banner, and intercept the network traffic using `tcpdump`, we can see what `Nmap` did not show us.

```shell-session
badgersec@htb[/htb]$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 10.10.14.2 and 10.129.2.28

tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode

```shell-session
