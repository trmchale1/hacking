# nmap scripting engine

Nmap Scripting Engine (`NSE`) is another handy feature of `Nmap`. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services. There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:

| **Category** |  **Description** |
| ------ | --------- |
| `auth` | Determination of authentication credentials. |
|`broadcast` |Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.| 
| `brute` | Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials. |
| `default` | Default scripts executed by using the `-sC` option. |
| `discovery` | Evaluation of accessible services. |
| `dos` | These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services. |`exploit` | This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port. |
| `external` | Scripts that use external services for further processing. |
| `fuzzer` | This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time. |
| `intrusive` | Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system. |
| `malware` | Checks if some malware infects the target system. |
| `safe` | Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access. |
| `version` | Extension for service detection. |
| `vuln` | Identification of specific vulnerabilities. |

For example, let us keep working with the target SMTP port and see the results we get with two defined scripts.

#### Nmap - Specifying Scripts

```shell-session
badgersec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-16 23:21 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
Host is up (0.050s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
25/tcp open  smtp
|_banner: 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)
|_smtp-commands: inlane, PIPELINING, SIZE 10240000, VRFY, ETRN, STARTTLS, ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES, 8BITMIME, DSN, SMTPUTF8,
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)
```

We see that we can recognize the **Ubuntu** distribution of Linux by using the' banner' script. The `smtp-commands` script shows us which commands we can use by interacting with the target SMTP server. In this example, such information may help us to find out existing users on the target. `Nmap` also gives us the ability to scan our target with the aggressive option (`-A`). This scans the target with multiple options as service detection (`-sV`), OS detection (`-O`), traceroute (`--traceroute`), and with the default NSE scripts (`-sC`).

## Vulnerability Assessment

Now let us move on to HTTP port 80 and see what information and vulnerabilities we can find using the `vuln` category from `NSE`.

#### Nmap - Vuln Category
