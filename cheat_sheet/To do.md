- update timmchale.co to include spaces and improve readability, add notes about learnings and tools from linux

- Around 41 incomplete boxes in the lab's to do list, do at least one lab and one writeup per day

### Academy Review

- To get a shell, review notes on the boxes you've hacked
- "passwords" - Go through the boxes you've hacked for different flags for hashcat
- "Active Directory" - There are some 3rd party tools, used in your hacks that would be useful to take notes on, cross-check with the academy, especially later modules used in advanced hacks, ignore powershell commands
- "XSS Cross-Site Scripting" - more research *important*, actually use the academy for this
- "Linux/Windows Priv Escalation" - research *important*, good information in here

Can you do "Attacking Enterprise Networks" blind? If so, sit for the exam.

Try Pro Labs Dante and Zephyr.
