The use of cloud, such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), and others, is now one of the essential components for many companies nowadays. After all, all companies want to be able to do their work from anywhere, so they need a central point for all management. This is why services from `Amazon` (`AWS`), `Google` (`GCP`), and `Microsoft` (`Azure`) are ideal for this purpose.

Even though cloud providers secure their infrastructure centrally, this does not mean that companies are free from vulnerabilities. The configurations made by the administrators may nevertheless make the company's cloud resources vulnerable. This often starts with the `S3 buckets` (AWS), `blobs` (Azure), `cloud storage` (GCP), which can be accessed without authentication if configured incorrectly.

Often cloud storage is added to the DNS list when used for administrative purposes by other employees. This step makes it much easier for the employees to reach and manage them. Let us stay with the case that a company has contracted us, and during the IP lookup, we have already seen that one IP address belongs to the `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com` server.

However, there are many different ways to find such cloud storage. One of the easiest and most used is Google search combined with Google Dorks. For example, we can use the Google Dorks `inurl:` and `intext:` to narrow our search to specific terms. In the following example, we see red censored areas containing the company name.
